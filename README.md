### Description

This project focuses on configuring and programming an ATmega328P microcontroller to operate LEDs, read analog signals from potentiometers and various sensors, and transmit data via UART. I implemented interrupt-driven event handling and timer-based control logic to build responsive embedded solutions. The project aim to larn low-level hardware interfacing, real-time signal processing and embedded C architecture.

### ðŸ§° Tools & Environment

Microcontroller: ATmega328P
IDE / Compiler: AVR-GCC
Flashing Tool: avrdude
Programming Language: C
Hardware Used: Breadboard, LEDs, sensors, potentiometer, USB-to-serial adapter


### ðŸ§  Main concepts

-> Understanding microcontroller architecture
-> Interfacing hardware components (LEDs, sensors, potentiometers)
-> Managing asynchronous events with interrupts
-> Implementing communication via UART
-> Using timers for signal generation and delay management

### Summury

Module01 -> LED control (blinking sequences and PWM dimming)
Module02 -> UART communication for serial data transmission
Module04 -> Timer configuration for precise time-based tasks
Module04 -> Interrupt handling for real-time event management
Module05 -> analog temperature sensor data using the ADC convert component
