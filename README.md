This project focuses on configuring and programming an ATmega328P microcontroller to operate LEDs, read analog signals from potentiometers and various sensors, and transmit data via UART. I implemented interrupt-driven event handling and timer-based control logic to build responsive embedded solutions. The project aim to larn low-level hardware interfacing, real-time signal processing and embedded C architecture.
