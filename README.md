### Description

This project focuses on configuring and programming an ATmega328P microcontroller to operate LEDs, read analog signals from potentiometers and various sensors, and transmit data via UART. I implemented interrupt-driven event handling and timer-based control logic to build responsive embedded solutions. The project aim to larn low-level hardware interfacing, real-time signal processing and embedded C architecture.

### Main concepts

-> Understanding microcontroller architecture
-> Interfacing hardware components (LEDs, sensors, potentiometers)
-> Managing asynchronous events with interrupts
-> Implementing communication via UART
-> Using timers for signal generation and delay management
